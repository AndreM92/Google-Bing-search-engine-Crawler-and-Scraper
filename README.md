# Google-Search-Scraper
This program analyzes the online visibility of selected companies based on google search results. </br>

## onlineVisibilityBroker
I have applied this program on 15 popular German Brokers and selected 5 keywords. </br>
It uses ChromeDriver and Selenium to crawl through the google search engine and scrapes all the relevant data with BeautifulSoup. </br>

Please note that it is written for German search results. If you want to use it for your purposes, you maybe need to change terms like 'Anzeige' to 'ad'. You also have to install a driver and all the required packages first to make it work.
